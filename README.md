## Program designed to remotely control an Elecraft K4 transceiver

This program has been renamed and moved to a new repository:
https://github.com/DaleFarnsworth/K4-Companion where further
development will continue

I apologize for the inconvenience.

K4-Companion is an application written in python3 that can remotely
control and Elecraft K4 tranceiver via TCP/IP.  It currently controls
the main K4 features and is very useable as is, but new features are
being added all the time.  K4-Companion is very configurable.

K4-Companion began life as a simple macro-sending program called
K4Macro-Python, created by Charles Powell, NK8O. It has now grown far
beyond a simple macro-sending program into a full-fledged remote control
program for the K4.

Please send problem reports either: by sending an email, by entering
an issue on github, or by making a pull request. Problem reports and
suggesions are greatly appreciated.

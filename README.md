## Program designed to remotely control an Elecraft K4 transceiver

k4macro provides a set of buttons, each of which when clicked will
send a macro string to the Elecraft K4 via TCP/IP.  It is capable of
sending string commands to multiple servers, one or more which may
be transceivers. These macros can be simple or complex. This program
was inspired by K4 Macromaster, but in no way duplicates all of its
functions. K4 Macro was initially created by Charles W. Powell, NK8O,
but has been heavily modified. Charles has graciously allowed me to
continue development and to release it under the GPL.
